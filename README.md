# Fetch Info Script

A minimilistic script which fetches and displays select system information, which includes OS details, kernel version, uptime, number of installed packages, and window manager information. It also displays a cute and small ASCII art of an anime girl wearing a magic wizard hat. When I feel like it I will update it with more new, original ASCII art in the future.
## Features

- **OS Information**: Displays the operating system name and version.
- **Kernel Information**: Shows the kernel version in a short format.
- **Uptime**: Provides the system uptime in hours and minutes.
- **Installed Packages**: Counts the number of installed packages for various package managers.
- **Window Manager**: Identifies the current window manager or desktop environment.
- **ASCII Art**: Displays a cute ASCII art. Additionally you may configure ascii art of your own choice.
